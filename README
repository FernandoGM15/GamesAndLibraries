# Games & Libraries
This is a personal project, wich was created for the Sotfware Quality And Testing Class, Originally this project was made in Python 3, using flask and sqlite.

Now this version is made as a MEAN STACK (taking the "M" for MYSQL ^^').

## RUNNING THE APP
This project requires docker.
Once cloned the repository to the local run:
```sh
    docker compose up
```

Inside the project's folder, to deploy the node and mysql images from dockerhub.

Next run:
```sh
    docker compose run node dist/models/Init
```
To generate the necessary tables into database, you can use a remote mysql database manager as Mysql Workbench to watch the created tables.

Finally run:
```sh
    npm run start
```

Inside 'GamesProjectFront' folder, to initialize the angular's virtual server and test the app.
